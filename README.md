## üóÑÔ∏è Backend API

Written in Ruby on Rails: [Wrdy API](https://github.com/pasikonik/wrdy-api)

## üí° Inspiration

The application was inspired by [Vocabla](https://vocabla.com/), which is no longer maintained. Its functionality was very similar to the concept of Wrdy. This project will be a slightly simplified version with the addition of more versatile ability to import vocabulary from external sources (eg. file csv).
