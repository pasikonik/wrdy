## 🗄️ Backend API

Written in Ruby on Rails: [Wrdy API](https://github.com/pasikonik/wrdy-api)

## 💡 Inspiration

The application was inspired by [Vocabla](https://vocabla.com/), which is no longer maintained. Its functionality was very similar to the concept of Wrdy. This project will be a slightly simplified version with the addition of greater ability to upload vocabulary from external sources.
